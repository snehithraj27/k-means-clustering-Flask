# k-means-clustering-Flask

The Titanic data set cna be found in the below link: 
biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic3.xls 

lists the passengers and information about them on the Titanic (when it sank). 

In this Project k-means clustering is performed on the titanic (or similar) data set,  
on various (different) attributes (columns), specify number of clusters and results
are shown in a table (number of points in a cluster, distances between centroids,  
how tightly “packed” clusters are…) 

For example: 
•	For 5 clusters: 
•	Fare price and Age 
•	Surviving and Fare Price 
•	Cabin and Fare Price 
•	Repeat for 20 clusters. 
•	Repeat for 100 clusters. 

Showing results (total number of points, number of clusters centroid locations, 
distances, etc.) on a web page.  

Interpretation of  results: 
How many clusters is “appropriate” (5, 10, 100?) and why?
